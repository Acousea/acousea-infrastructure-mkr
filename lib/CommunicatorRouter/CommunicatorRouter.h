/**
 * @brief Relay class that acts as a bridge between two communicators and a processor
 * 
 * This class is responsible for relaying packets between two communicators and a processor.
 * If the packet is for this device, it will be processed by the processor. 
 * Otherwise, it will be relayed to other communicator, depending on the recipient address.
 * 
 *  BACKEND <-> LOCALIZER <-> DRIFTER <-> PI3   
 * 
 *  PrimaryCommunicator --- [[MKR 1310]] --- SecondaryCommunicator 
 *  
 *  FORWARDING RULES: (Drifter) -> Scheme:  LoraCommunicator --- [[MKR 1310]] --- SerialCommunicator
 *  - Messages to the drifter/localizer from the backend come through the primary communicator, which can be 
 *    either LoRa or Serial communicator.
 *  - Messages to the drifter from the PI3 come through the secondary communicator, which is the Serial communicator.
 * 
 *  FORWARDING RULES: (Localizer) -> Scheme:  SerialCommunicator --- [[MKR 1310]] --- LoraCommunicator
 *  - Messages to the localizer from the drifter/PI3 come through the secondary communicator, whicih can be 
 *    either LoRa or Serial communicator.
 *  - Messages from the backend to the localizer come through the primary communicator, which is Serial communicator.  * 
 * 
 *  In this scenario, the primary and secondary communicators can be inverted, depending on the device running the code.
