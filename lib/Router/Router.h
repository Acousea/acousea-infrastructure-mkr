/**
 * @brief Relay class that acts as a bridge between two ports and a processor
 * 
 * This class is responsible for relaying packets between two ports and a processor.
 * If the packet is for this device, it will be processed by the processor. 
 * Otherwise, it will be relayed to other port, depending on the recipient address.
 * 
 *  BACKEND <-> LOCALIZER <-> DRIFTER <-> PI3   
 * 
 *  PrimaryPort --- [[MKR 1310]] --- SecondaryPort 
 *  
 *  FORWARDING RULES: (Drifter) -> Scheme:  LoraPort --- [[MKR 1310]] --- SerialPort
 *  - Messages to the drifter/localizer from the backend come through the primary port, which can be 
 *    either LoRa or Serial port.
 *  - Messages to the drifter from the PI3 come through the secondary port, which is the Serial port.
 * 
 *  FORWARDING RULES: (Localizer) -> Scheme:  SerialPort --- [[MKR 1310]] --- LoraPort
 *  - Messages to the localizer from the drifter/PI3 come through the secondary port, whicih can be 
 *    either LoRa or Serial port.
 *  - Messages from the backend to the localizer come through the primary port, which is Serial port.  * 
 * 
 *  In this scenario, the primary and secondary ports can be inverted, depending on the device running the code.
